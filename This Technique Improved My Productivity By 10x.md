## Scenario

### Intro:
	I strugle with procrastination a lot, I will even leave task that I need to do till the last moments, and create excuses such as saying that I am not prepared yet, or that I don't have the necesarry skill or I am waiting for the best moment; Do you have the same problems? Acording to this source about 20% of adults are chronic procrastinators.

### Main
	There are 5 techniques and tips that really helped me, and I won't talk what uou need to know, because knowing won't change anything if you don't do something with what you have learned, instead in this video the will be actionable stelps you have to take if you really want to Destroy your Procrastination and your excuses.
#### The Done Manifesto: 
	First, the Done Manifestom and more secifically the 5th point _"Bansih Procrastination: If you wait more than a week to get an idea done, abandon it"_. I found about The Done Manifesto from this channel (link in desc). I have implemented the 5th point in my own life, and the results are pretty good, although I have abandoned more than 5 ideas already. So what does it actually mean, well think of an idea that you really want to do, you probably have something in your mind at this moment, and if you don't, pause the video and think of one right now. This is your first actionable step: from now you have ecactly one week to complete this idea, and do something, I don't care about your excuses, if you don't then abandon this idea forever, it's useless if it's only an idea anyway. So go and set an alarm one week from now to remind yourself if you did what you intended to do or if you did not.

#### Make Habits Easy To Do And Hard To Avoid
	The second techinque I want ot talk about comes from this book called "Atomic Habits" bu James Clear and it is designed to make the good habits or more generally what you have to do much easier to do and harder to avoid. Take for example this story, I belive it's also written in the book, but I am not entirely sure: "Let's say you want ot get better at playing the guitar, but instead of practicing you watch TV, that's because it's much easier to sit in the couch and to turn on the TV when the remote is right next to you, compared to playing the guitar who it is in the closet in the other room. So what do you have to do? The answer is to make it much easier to pick the guitar and practice rather than to watch TV. How can you do that? The best way it would be to place the guitar in the middle of the room instad of in another room in a closet and to take out the batteries from inside of the remote and hide somewhere." The message from this story is that you need to design your environment for success, make the task you have to do easy to start and impossible to skip. The way I use this technique is: If I Have to do something online I leave some tabs open so the next day when I open Chrome, I immediatly have the things I want to do right in front of me for example CodeWars or a Google Document, but if the work I have to do is in real life I leave on my desk things that I need to do for example a paper for writing this script or the homework for the next day for school. To summarize - set your enviroment for success, place the things that you want or have to do in places you can't avoid.

#### Accountability Partner
	The third techinque I use to be more productive is to have an accountability partener. But what does that mean and how does it work? It means to have a friend or a person in general who will keep you accountable and motivate you when you're feeling a bit lazy. The way I do it is: if I don't do what I said I would by a date, I have to give my friend a dollar, it's not much, but still it's wasted money, and by trying to not loose my money, I am motivated to do what I said I would and do it faster and more efficiently. The 3rd tip is to have someone to help you, if you can.

#### 60 - 10 Pomodoro
	The 4th technique is more related to the time spent working, unlike the other ones wich are more related to the time before actually working, and more precisely it is how I manage time doing and breaks. This technique is called 60-10 Pomodoro, it is similar to the normal Pomodoro technique you probably heard of where you study or do something for 25 minutes, relax for 5 minutes and repeat for a number of times. Unlike the 25-5 Pomodoro in this one you work for 60 minutes and rest for 10. Why this technique and not the other? I have tried both, and they are 100% better than no plan at all, but for me, the 25-5 one is a bit akward. I felt like 25 minutes was not enough time, for me personally it takes me like 10 to 15 minutes to get into the flow state, where I am really focused about what I am doing, and I would be left with 10 to 15 minutes of actually doing things productivily, then suddently getting interupted by the timer and loosing my train of thought. And I encountered similar problems with the breaks aswell. In those breaks I usually like to go outside and play with my dog rather than looking on my phone wich it's not recomended. And by only having 5 minutes I would be interupted and habing to abandon. That's why I don't use the 25-5 Pomodoro technique and instead use the 60-10. Although I've also encountered some problems with this technique aswell: I still don't know what to do if I finish what I have to do earlier, and so I just end up screwing my rest of my plans. To summarize, while working I use the 60-10 Pomodoro technique, where I do the thing for 60 minutes, rest for 10 minutes and then repeat like 2-3 times or until the work is done.
#### Don't Miss Twice
	The last tip I want to tell you is to never Miss Twice. It means that if you by mistake skipped or did not do what you had to do in time, next time you absolutely have to do it. If you miss doing it again you will form a habbit. And a bad one in this case. Ofcoarse if the reason you couldn't do it was not in your power don't beat yourself over it and try your best next time, but don't just invent excuses. Always try to be consistent, and if sometimes you can't and skip once, do your best to do it next time.

### Outro
	I hope you have learned something valuable from this video, and that you will do the actionable step in the video and that you will Banish your Procrastination. Take care!
